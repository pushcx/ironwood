Fun ideas:
  add 'sable cape of night': http://scarygoround.com/sgr/ar.php?date=20040819
  cape of invisibility that uses mana only when someone's looking
  item that charges while player is 'hidden', defined as:
  total distance travelled since last spot, * proximity
  animations to magic (like nethack wand) or combat, etc
  bloodstains
  combos: regular movement interpreted as combat
  step forward 3 squares and attack straight or diag: 'charging'
  attack, parry, attack: counterattack
  attack, step diag, attack: sideswipe
  attack front, attack behind: double-play
  stab from behind: backstab
  several steps, attack at 90, step away: drive-by
  arc: sword attack N also strikes NW and NE
  enemy collapses, you attack: coup de grace
  enemy flees, you step in and attack: merciless
  attack several directions in turn: whirlwind
  attack enemy against wall: cornering
  alternate directions when moving toward/away: evasion
  long weapon to hit two enemies in line: pierce
  when touching, wait and then attack: power attack
  move between two enemies, attack both: spurt slash
  rage: stat that gains power the longer you're in combat, opens options
  do something special when player is one turn from detection or death
  pauses - when you open the big chest, build tension by pausing a sec
  rolling tension: prepare, combat, rest, repeat. maybe shorten to build
