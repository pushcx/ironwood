  total distance travelled since last spot, * proximity
* animations to magic (like nethack wand) or combat, etc
* bloodstains
* combos: regular movement interpreted as 
  step forward 3 squares and attack straight or diag: 'charging'
  attack, parry, attack: counterattack
  attack, step diag, attack: sideswipe
* do something special when player is one turn from detection or death

* rolling tension: prepare, combat, rest, repeat. maybe shorten to build


* maybe a game about giving up possessions, owning less?
